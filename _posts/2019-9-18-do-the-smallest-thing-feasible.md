Commitments are no longer commitments when you start making excuses. 

Even on the days you really don't feel like keeping the commitment, figure out the smallest possible thing you can do to keep the chain going. 

That's how a habit is built, by pushing even on the toughest days to keep the commitments. 

Make it easier for yourself to keep going by doing the smallest thing feasible. 

That's exactly what I am doing right now :).

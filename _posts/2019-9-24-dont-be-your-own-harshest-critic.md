title: Don't be your own harshest critic.
published: true

We often focus too much on our faults rather than strengths. 

We stress over every little thing we mess up, and worry that if we don't do something or be someone, people will dislike and leave us.

We force ourselves to be productive and put together at all times, getting frustrated over times we are not.

We often are our own harshest critics. 

Don't be. 

Look at your strengths rather than stressing over your weaknesses. 

Instead of worrying that someone will dislike and leave you over something trivial, know your own values and find people who will see through those. Surround yourself with people who will support and care for you with love.

It's great to be disciplined, but cut yourself some slack from time to time. You are not a robot desinged to work and be productive all the time. 

You need breaks and breathing room.

Reward yourself amply and don't forget to pat yourself in the back even for trivial things.

These little positivities towards self will add up to build self-esteem and self-confidence to take on the tougher, external factors in life that you have no control over.

And you know what? The more compassionate you are to yourself, the more compassionate you will be to others.

So take a break today. Look at yourself in the mirror and command that person for everything he or she's done for you.

"Without you, I won't be here, and I will be here with you every step of the way until the end of it all." 

If you can't be your most vigorous supporter, no one will ever be.

What really matters in your life? 

Hard question, indeed. 

As you shape your own answers to this question, though, one other important thing to make sure is that you actually design your life to be going after those things that really matter to you.

And this is extremely hard as there are too many distractions that you will be drawn to on  the way.

Without a clear direction and a constant introspection, it is so easy to lose that initial aim and blindly optimizing locally for what everyone else is going after.

Play the long game. What would ultimately leave you with no regrets when you leave this world?

Of the five stages of David Allen's Getting Things Done (GTD)--Capture, Clarify, Organize, Reflect, and Engage--the most difficult stage to follow through is Reflect.

Without that reflection, however, your consistency will suffer. 

A few days, a few weeks even, you will be able to carry out the process, but without regular reflection to undesrtand your input/output and pivot if necessary, you won't be able to self-correct when you start missing a couple. 

Applies to general life as well. It's easy to get trapped in the nitty-gritty of everyday to not find time to reflect. 

But without reflection, you won't be able to understand and correct your overall direction. 

Reflection gives you the ultimate control of your life directions. Make sure you make time for it.

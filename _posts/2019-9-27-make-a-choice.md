Sometimes, you need to make a choice. 

It would be ideal if we can do and be everything that we desire, but that simply is not the case. 

Some paths and options in life are mutually exclusive, each being trade-offs of the other. 

You choose one, and you let one go. You can't have it all. 

So beware of your choices and their trade-offs. 

Remember that the decisions we make given these different, mutually exclusive choices ("the crossroads") make up and define our character. 

Choose wisely.

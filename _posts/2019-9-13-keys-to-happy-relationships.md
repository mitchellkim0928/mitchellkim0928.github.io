1. Lower your expectations. Rather, be the person you want in your life first.
2. You get what you put in. Actively invest in the relationships you want to build, grow, and maintain. 
3. You won't get along with everyone and that's fine. But, don't be haste to judge. Problem may be you, or may just be the circumstances.

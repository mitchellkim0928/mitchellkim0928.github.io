As I was writing down some lessons learned in the past year, I felt overwhelming gratitude towards a certain group of people that taught me these invaluable lessons.

Without her, without them, I would be a miserable mess right now.

But it's so easy to forget that you were helped. 

After all, we want to feel good about ourselves, it's a shame to acknowledge our past faults and the fact that we weren't able to get out on our own, and we all want to pad ourselves on the back for the accomplishments in our lives.

I'm not saying to not give yourself any credit. Go pad yourself on the back.

But know that without those people who lift you up during hard times and teaches you invaluable lessons sometimes through tough love, you won't be here. You will be a completely different person, and I bet ya you would be a worse version of yourself than your current self. 

Be thankful. Don't just stop there and express your gratitude for those amazing people. Hold onto them tight and always ask yourself, 'What can I do for them?' 

My biggest fear is to forget this myself.

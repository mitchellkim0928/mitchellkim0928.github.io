It's not about you all the time. People don't really care at all about others. At least, not as much as you think they would. 

If it is hard for you to get out of your head and care less about other people's perceptions, try to reverse the situation and put yourself in others' shoes. 

There are so many things going on in everyone's life, one could have random (or justified) mood swings, and they have other priorities than to dissect who you are and how you are behaving. 

If you try too hard to appease others and appear a certain way to them, it'll clearly show. We all know that person. 

So relax, and focus on having a great time with our without the person in the present moment. 

The only opinion about you that truly matters is your own.

A blog to archive the lessons I am learning in life through a format of letters to self. 

Writing to clear my head, keep regular commitments with myself, and be held accountable for my ideas in hopes that they will help somebody else out there. 

Inspired by Rohan Rajiv's [A Learning a Day](https://alearningaday.blog/), Seth Godin's [blog](https://seths.blog/), and [머니맨](http://moneyman.kr/).
